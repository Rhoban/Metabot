# Assembling Metabot bot

[« back to the documentation](index.md)

Let's go on!
Now you have all your [parts](parts.md) ready, and your servos [numbered from
1 to 12](ids.md), you can follow this tutorial to assemble your bot.

## Warning

**Be careful: read all the assemble tutorial before begining, if you want to
avoid changing the software, you have to respect the motors direction and IDs**

Before begining, pay attention to the motors IDs and orientations:

## 1) Bind the Us

First, we're going to bind the Us, to do that, just use screws, or glue:

## 2) Put motors on the Us

Now, we're going to put the motors on the Us, just like this:

![Motors on the Us](imgs/motors-us.jpg)

To do this, you'll need to use Ollo rivets, first, place your motor arm correctly,
if the dot on the arm is like this:

![Zero dot](imgs/zero-dot.jpg)

Then the motor is correctly on its "zero position". Put it in the U and put rivets
in it:

Now, "lock" these rivets putting smallest parts in it, like this:

![Rivet](imgs/rivet-u-2.jpg)

On the other side, insert first a pulley and then put a longest rivet in it:

![Pulley rivet](imgs/pulley-rivet.jpg)

You can now lock it and put smallest rivets. Repeat this operation to put the
second motor:

## 3) Bind the body

Now, bind all the 4 parts you've done using the bodies:

## 4) Put the wires

You can now put the wires, for each legs, so it looks like this:

![Wires](imgs/wires.jpg)

## 5) Put the side parts

These parts are a little bit tricky to put, because you have to enclose the
wire betweet the part and the motor, there is a little gap that allows it:

![Side](imgs/side.jpg)

Do the same for the other side, this time, you'll have to enclose the two
sides of the wire:

![Side](imgs/side2.jpg)

## 6) Put the legs

You can do exactly the same as before to put the legs on:

![One leg](imgs/one-leg.jpg)

## 7) Put the electronics on your robot

**This part of the documentation will updated soon**

## Ready!

Your robot is now almost ready!
